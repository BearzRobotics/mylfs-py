# There was one failed build I didn't expect. That is becasue I didn't have qt6 as a dep.
# In the past it built because I restarted the build with ./mylfs --start-phase 5
# this is why it's a good idea if you add a lot of packages to do a complete build to make 
# sure everything is good. I patched the recipes and will restart it and it will build just fine.
# This build on my computer took 12:14:24 elapsed of "clock time", however utilizing my computer 
# the equivalant man time? CPU cycle time? was 99838.27 seconds or ~27.73


# Inside your build dir where the new root filesystem takes place is a logs directory. 
# I'll copy that from this build dir to res/logs and res/logs2 will be the rebuild for 
# that one unexpected failed package.

# Logs dirs are in the tarball

# as root
