summary: Brushstroke engine library for graphics applications
description: |
  libmypaint is a C library implementing a brushstroke engine 
  used by graphics applications such as MyPaint and GIMP. 
  It provides smooth, pressure-sensitive brush simulation 
  designed for tablets and natural media painting. 
  The library is independent of any GUI and focuses purely 
  on brush dynamics and painting logic.
