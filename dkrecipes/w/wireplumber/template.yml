  # First, kill any previous instances of pipewire, wireplumber, or pipewire-pulse
  # that are running. Multiple instances of the daemon can not be run at the same
  # time, and this helps prevent possible errors if a user logs out or logs in
  # too fast, and restores audio if Pipewire hangs and needs to be reset.

  exec /usr/bin/pipewire &

  # Next, we need to wait until pipewire is up before starting wireplumber.
