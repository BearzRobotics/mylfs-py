  SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) is a compiler that integrates C and C++ with languages including Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby, PHP, Java, JavaScript, C#, D, Go, Lua, Octave, R, Racket, Scilab, Scheme, and Ocaml. SWIG can also export its parse tree into Lisp s-expressions and XML.
  SWIG reads annotated C/C++ header files and creates wrapper code (glue code) in order to make the corresponding C/C++ libraries available to the listed languages, or to extend C/C++ programs with a scripting language.
