summary: Lightweight TTY system monitor client for sysmond
description: |
  sysmon3 is a lightweight TTY-based system monitor that connects 
  to the sysmond daemon to display real-time system statistics 
  such as CPU usage, memory usage, temperatures, and disk usage. 
  Designed for simple Linux systems, it is ideal for TTY environments 
  where graphical monitoring tools are not available or not desired.
