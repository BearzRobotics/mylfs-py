summary: Sound eXchange - universal sound sample translator
description: |
  SoX is the Swiss Army knife of sound processing programs.
  It can convert various formats of audio files, apply effects,
  and play and record audio on most platforms.

# I Don't actually know all the deps.
# however, this is a music app and it seems natural that
# relying on ffmpeg is a good short cut to ensure it builds
builddeps: [glibc, libpng, alsa-li, sed, zlib, ffmpeg ]
