# I read an article on how ubuntu wants to experment using these in replace of GNU 
# coreutils. This by default builds a multi call binary that can be dropped in place 
# called coreutils. 

# This package is so I can play around with them on a secondary system to see if 
# they're ready. 

# if you use gnu make it will build individual binaries

summary: Rust rewrite of core Unix utilities
description: |
  uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU 
  coreutils collection in Rust. It aims to provide fast, safe, and 
  portable replacements for traditional Unix command-line utilities 
  such as ls, cat, cp, mv, rm, and many more.

  source /etc/profile
  
  # this builds a single multi call binrary 
  # cargo build --release
  # install -m755 target/release/coreutils /usr/bin/coreuilts

  # this builds individual executables for each command
  # the PROG_PREFIX adds whatever it equals in front of the binary making
  # it safe to install these along side GNU coreutils.
  make install PROG_PREFIX=uu_ PREFIX=/usr
