# This is being added to make it easier to use a verison 
# of rust not shipped with BLFS or a backend you would rather not build
# as it takes a long time. -- This is not a replacement for the system
# rust compiler in /opt/rust. If a system package requires a new rust version 
# you should up grade the system rust compiler.
